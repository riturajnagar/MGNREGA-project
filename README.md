Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 or MNREGA is an Indian labor law and social security measure that aims to guarantee the 'right to work'. This act was passed on 23 August 2005 under the UPA government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh following the tabling of the bill in parliament by the Minister for Rural Development Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.
It aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to at least one member of every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Women are guaranteed one-third of the jobs made available under the MGNREGA
